# Agent Command History API

The Metal3 Fleet terminal uses a tenant/project-scoped aggregate endpoint instead of issuing one request per Agent node.

## Endpoint

`GET /api/v1/tenants/{tenant_id}/projects/{project_id}/agent-commands/`

Query parameters:

- `limit`: 1–200, default 100.
- `offset`: non-negative integer, default 0.
- `status`: optional AgentCommand status.
- `node_id`: optional node UUID within the tenant/project scope.
- `command_type`: optional exact command type.

The response includes `count`, `limit`, `offset` and the standard Agent command payload. Commands are ordered newest-first. Tenant membership and project membership are checked using the same access rules as Agent node inventory. The API never returns commands from another project.

The Fleet UI refreshes persisted commands every 15 seconds and labels the terminal as a polling view. It is not a WebSocket stream. Durable command logs are available from the command result and error records; streaming log transport is a separate implementation phase.
